Welcome to EchoSight! This project was born during AI Hack 2024.

Imagine an AI assistant designed to empower people with visual impairments, providing enhanced awareness of their surroundings. Whether itâ€™s detecting obstacles in your path, notifying you of a letter or object on your desk, or offering real-time insights into an audienceâ€™s engagementâ€”EchoSight is here to support you.
